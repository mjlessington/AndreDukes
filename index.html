                    <h5>My Lens</h5>
                    Dr. Dukes hails from the Pee Dee Region of South Carolina. He was raised by his grandparents, the late James J. Dukes and Elrima Dukes. The ideals, work-ethic and values, for which he stands, can be attributed to the loving and supportive home they created at the family farm outside of Kingstree, South Carolina. He was also fortunate to have his mother, step-father, aunts, uncles and many cousins nearby as beacons of support and guidance during his formative years. It was during many days of summer toil on the Dukes Family Farm with his cousins and uncles that the institutions of hard work, innovation and follow-through were indoctrinated in him.  

                    After graduating from Kingstree Senior High School, Dr. Dukes received an Educational Doctoral degree from North Greenville University, Associate’s Degree (A.S), Bachelors of Arts (B.A), Masters of Secondary Administration (M.Ed) from Charleston Southern University and a Masters of Business Administration (M.B.A), Specialist degree from Webster University. Dr. Dukes also served as a member of the South Carolina Army National Guard.

                    As Mark Twain said, “Find a job you enjoy and you will never work a day in your life.” That statement has always resonated with Dr. Dukes. Dr. Dukes is an experienced educator with 19 years of experience, having served students in the largest (Greenville), second-largest (Charleston), and fifth-largest (Berkeley) school districts in the state of South Carolina. He is a dedicated leader with a commitment to moving organizations to increased significance and success through clear articulation of vision and meticulous execution. After teaching Business/Marketing/Entrepreneurship Classes and sponsoring DECA at Military Magnet and James Island Charter High Schools in Charleston, South Carolina, Dr. Dukes made his leap into school and teacher support as a data analyst and teacher coach at Cane Bay High School in Summerville, SC. While in Charleston County, Dr. Dukes led transformative change as a principal and assistant principal. To become more well-rounded as a leader, Dr. Dukes then sought an experience at a large, diverse, comprehensive high school as Assistant Principal at West Ashley High School. While at West Ashley, Dr. Dukes was named South Carolina High School Assistant Principal of the Year in 2014. As an administrator at St. John's High School, the school received its highest ranking on the school report card and also earned the highest graduation rate since the start of school accountability. Dr. Dukes currently serves as the principal of Southside High School. As principal, Dr. Dukes established ongoing accountability for all students through accelerated learning opportunities, early focus on inquiry-based learning, and equal access to programs, resources, and data for the educational advancement of all students. Dr. Dukes researched, designed, and implemented an AVID program (first high school in Greenville County Schools) to allow more educational opportunities for our first-generation students and created a college learning environment throughout the school.
                    <h5>Play</h5>
                    Dr. Dukes enjoys traveling (Miami, Chicago and NYC are a few favorites), college football (trying to get to all the stadiums in the SEC!), hiking, basketball, working-out and staying fit, gardening, being with his family and friends and 90’s hip hop and R&B. Dr. Dukes also recently earned his SC Realtors License.
                    
                    <h5>Community</h5>
                    Dr. Dukes enjoys giving back and interacting with his community. He is currently the Vice President of Alpha Lambda Sigma Chapter of Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, the Vice President of Charleston Southern University Alumni Board and the secretary for the Greenville Regional Advisory Career Board. 
                    He was named the South Carolina State Phi Beta Sigma Fraternity, Deputy Chief of Staff in 2019 and continues to serve in that role. 
                    He has won numerous academic and business awards, including the 2014 South Carolina Assistant Principal of the Year, 2017 Charleston 40 under 40 award Winner, and 2019 Phi Beta Sigma Education Award Recipient. 
                    Dr. Dukes is ready to serve districts, schools, and business organizations to impact positive change.

           Faith DiAngelis was born and raised in Brooklyn, NY. While attending Boston University as an undergraduate, she elected to spend a year studying abroad in Haifa, Israel. In addition to learning some of the jobs on a kibbutz, Faith also developed a lifelong love of travel and exploring new cultures, and has since visited more than twenty countries. During a graduate-level research fellowship in Experimental Psychology at Northeastern University, while serving as a teaching assistant for an undergraduate course, she discovered another passion- education. Ms DiAngelis pursued alternative licensure for secondary science teachers through an accelerated program at Bridgewater State College, and eventually settled on the Upper West Side of Manhattan. Working for the nation’s largest school district, the NYCDOE, Faith spent the first 12 years of her professional career at Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn, NY, one of the city’s last remaining large, comprehensive high schools. With a large immigrant population and over 200 native languages spoken by the student body, Faith developed a science course specifically for multilingual students, focusing on disciplinary literacy scaffolds and individual supports as her students developed content knowledge and increased English proficiency. Over time, she became a curriculum leader and developed the science programs for Twilight and Summer School, and earned her MS in Instructional Technology from Touro College in NYC. Ms DiAngelis also developed the curriculum and delivered instruction for two of the most popular science programs at Lincoln- AP Psychology and Social Science Research, which was a dual-credit collaboration through Kingsborough Community College. Eventually, Lincoln was divided into academies (small learning communities as a “school within a school” model), and Ms DiAngelis became the Pathway Coordinator for the Academy of Arts and Social Science Careers (AASSC). In this leadership role, Faith was able to steer groups of teachers through instructional moves that supported the academy’s mission and vision, such as targeted support for sub-groups of students and literacy initiatives throughout all content areas. After six years leading the AASSC, Faith became a mother of boy/girl twins and relocated to the Upstate of South Carolina in 2015. She taught Biology and Environmental Science at Travelers Rest High School for four years, bringing her previous leadership experience to bear on the Biology PLC, convincing other teachers to incorporate more literacy and inquiry activities into their instruction. Ms DiAngelis became a mentor at her new school, and was selected as the Science Department’s representative on the Faculty Council and at the ASCD National Conference on Leadership in Kissimmee, FL. The administration of TRHS recommended Faith for the Instructional Coach pool for Greenville County Schools, and in 2019, she was hired as the IC at Southside High School in Greenville, SC. In this role, Ms DiAngelis continues to develop her instructional and professional skills by leading teachers through innovative programs designed to develop them as leaders. From coaching cycles, to data analysis, to professional learning community support and teacher education programs, everything that Faith implements is designed to support the school mission of preparing all students to be college and career ready graduates.

            Lauren Prestino Friedrich was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York and has since made her
            home in Spartanburg, South Carolina. She found a passion for Early Childhood Education during
            her first course at City University of New York- Kingsborough. She went on to pursue Child
            Study at St. Joseph’s College and study Elementary Reading and Literacy at Walden University.
            
            All of her 18 years of teaching were spent in Pre-K/4K classrooms, both in New York and South
            Carolina. Lauren spent many years mentoring new, student and fellow teachers and thrives in
            collaborative and leadership roles. Most of her time in the classroom was spent teaching
            vulnerable populations and children from all over the world. Through this experience, Lauren
            learned the value of providing equitable experiences and differentiated instruction for children
            from all backgrounds, to create an atmosphere where all children can succeed. One of her
            proudest moments was winning Teacher of the Year in 2016 for South Carolina First Steps to
            School Readiness 4K.
            
            In addition to classroom experience, Lauren also spent two years doing ABA Therapy with
            children on the Autism spectrum. During this time, Lauren learned Behavior Analysis principles
            that not only were valuable in working with children with special needs, but also in the general
            education classroom and in the workplace.
            
            Lauren has three years of Conscious Discipline training and classroom execution. She is a firm
            believer in explicitly teaching social emotional skills to young children so that they can build
            self-regulation and mindfulness.
            
            Lauren has always been extremely passionate about the importance of early childhood education
            and instilling in children the foundational skills they need to succeed in later years. Knowing that
            learning through play is the key in early childhood, she began volunteering with The Children’s
            Museum of the Upstate as they formed focus groups to plan a new branch in Spartanburg. In
            2018, Lauren made the transition from classroom teaching to informal education as the Early
            Childhood Specialist of the upcoming branch. She was drawn to the mission of the museum
            because it was set to focus on early childhood and kindergarten readiness, which was lacking in
            the community. She was quickly promoted to Director and spent her three year tenure coaching
            
            staff on the execution of educational programming, collaborating with non-profits on community
            initiatives and planning learning opportunities for local educators. What Lauren is most proud of
            are the diversity, equity and inclusivity initiatives she developed and introduced based on
            research, Continuous Improvement and community input.
            
            Lauren has been lucky enough to attend numerous conferences, including the National
            Association for the Education of Young Children, the South Carolina Early Childhood
            Association and the Carolina Play Summit. She believes in keeping on top of educational trends
            and research in order to give children the best opportunities possible.
            
            In addition to education, Lauren has a love of travel! Her favorite places include tropical
            beaches, but most of her recent travels have been to visit her family living in New York, New
            Jersey and California. She has a deep love of animals and rescued and fostered a number of cats
            and dogs. Lauren now lives in Spartanburg with her husband, dog and two cats.
            
            Lauren is extremely excited to be joining the Innovative Strategic Solutions team and is looking
            forward to sharing her knowledge and passion for helping children, and the community as a
            whole, to see their full potential through education.

            I joined Greenville County Schools in 2001 as the teacher and coach
            at Mauldin High School in Mauldin, SC. I currently serve as the
            assistant principal over curriculum and instruction at Southside High
            School in Greenville, SC.
            Prior to Greenville County schools, I was a Human Resources
            Manager at a mid-size company, Southport Cutting-a Division on Levi
            Strauss. During my tenure at Southport Cutting, I also performed
            duties in Hiring, Accounting, and Project Management. During my 3
            years at Southport, we boasted a 10% rise in quality assurance, which
            informed a 15% rise in earning for our 50 plus employees.
            In my 20 years in Greenville County, I have worked as a teacher, head
            athletic coach, Assistant Athletic Director, Instructional Coach, Special
            Education Coordinator, and Assistant Principal. As an assistant
            principal my focus is in curriculum and instruction. Finding unique and
            innovative approaches to building capacity in teachers and students is
            what drives me daily. My thirst for learning continues to enable me to
            seek out instructional practices and professional development that is
            tailored for the unique needs of the students and teachers I serve. My
            strengths as a strategist, as well as, being analytical and a relator has
            not only helped me to build systems in instruction and leadership that
            work, but also provide avenues of growth for both our students and
            teachers.
            I am a graduate of Converse College, where I majored in Psychology
            with a minor in English and math. I currently live in Greer, SC with my
            13-year-old son. When I’m not keeping busy with my duties as an
            Assistant Principal at Southside High School, you can find me
            traveling, reading, or spending time with family and friends.
